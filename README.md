## Conclusions
In summary, the analysis of football fan engagement on Facebook highlights significant patterns related to sentiments, user demographics, and verification status. With over 99% of users having unverified accounts, a gender-based disparity in participation is evident, with male users dominating the comment section. Despite the prevalence of unverified accounts, the study suggests that verification status does not strongly correlate with sentiment expression.
Sentiment analysis reveals that around 64.65% of comments are positive, 26.39% are neutral, and 8.96% are negative. Male and female users express similar sentiment distributions, while neuter and unknown genders predominantly express positive sentiments.
The unknown gender category stands out for predominantly positive comments, warranting further investigation. Negative sentiment comments attract higher engagement, suggesting a need to address negative sentiments and foster positive community engagement in social media strategies.
The study lays a foundation for understanding football fan engagement, emphasizing the importance of recognizing diverse user segments. Continuous monitoring and additional analyses will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of fan behavior over time.
